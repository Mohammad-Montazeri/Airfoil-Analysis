# Content 

This repository contains the material delivered for the final project of the course *Fluid Dynamics II* lectured by *Dr. Azadeh Jafari*. In this project we were supposed to simulate an airfoil numerically to study its aerodynamic characteristics using **ANSYS Fluent** software. For this purpose, we have taken these steps: 

- Consider a proper domain for our numerical study
- Generate a suitable grid for our fluid domain based on the turbulence model we are implementing
- Choose 𝑘 − 𝜖 or 𝑘 − 𝜔 turbulent models
- Use second order upwind scheme for the convective term’s discretization


# Project Tasks
1. Draw the pressure distribution curve in different angles of attack in one plot and analyze the results. (At least 6 different angles)
2. By calculating the lift and drag coefficients in different angles of attack up to the onset of the stall phenomenon, validate your results with the experimental data represented in appendix IV of the source book [^1].
3. Compare the zero-lift angle of attack and slop of the lift coefficient curve versus the angle of attack with the relation of the thin airfoil theory and experimental data.
1. Investigate the use of other numerical methods, their application and their differences.
2. Research the different methods used to manufacture airfoils, such as computer numerical control (CNC) machining, 3D printing, and composite layup and explore the use of airfoil simulation software, such as ANSYS Fluent or XFOIL, and how it is used in industry and academia to design and optimize airfoils.
1. Research the purpose of prism layer meshing and the meaning of $y^+$.
